**Container:** A way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration
- It can be easily shared
- Makes Deployment & Development Efficient

**Docker Theory:** 
- Docker is an Open Source centralised platform designed to create, deploy & run applications
- Docker uses container on the host OS to run application. It allows applications to use the same linux Kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.
- We can install docker on any OS but Docker engine run natively on linux distribution.
- Docker Written in **GO** language.
- Docker is a tool that perform OS level virtualization, also known as containerization.
- Before Docker many users faces the problem that a particular code is running in the developer system but not in the users system.
