**Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers. These containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent across different environmentsâ€”making it easier to develop, ship, and run software anywhere.**

**Container:** A way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration
- It can be easily shared
- Makes Deployment & Development Efficient

**Docker Theory:** 
- Docker is an Open Source centralised platform designed to create, deploy & run applications
- Docker uses container on the host OS to run application. It allows applications to use the same linux Kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.
- We can install docker on any OS but Docker engine run natively on linux distribution.
- Docker Written in **GO** language.
- Docker is a tool that perform OS level virtualization, also known as containerization.
- Before Docker many users faces the problem that a particular code is running in the developer system but not in the users system.
- Docker was first release in March 2013 it is developed y solomon nykes and sebastian panl.
- Docker is a set of platform as a service that uses OS level virtualization whereas VMware uses hardware level virtualization.

**Difference between Docker Container vs VMs**

**Docker Container:** 
- Low impact on OS, very fast, low disk space usage.
- Sharing, distribution and re-building is easy.
- Encapsulate apps instead of whole machine.

**VMs:** 
- High impact on OS, Slower, high disk usage.
- Sharing, rebuilding and distribution is challenging.
- Encapsulate whole machine.
