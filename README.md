**Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers. These containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent across different environmentsâ€”making it easier to develop, ship, and run software anywhere.**

**Container:** A way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration
- It can be easily shared
- Makes Deployment & Development Efficient

**Docker Theory:** 
- Docker is an Open Source centralised platform designed to create, deploy & run applications
- Docker uses container on the host OS to run application. It allows applications to use the same linux Kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.
- We can install docker on any OS but Docker engine run natively on linux distribution.
- Docker Written in **GO** language.
- Docker is a tool that perform OS level virtualization, also known as containerization.
- Before Docker many users faces the problem that a particular code is running in the developer system but not in the users system.
- Docker was first release in March 2013 it is developed y solomon nykes and sebastian panl.
- Docker is a set of platform as a service that uses OS level virtualization whereas VMware uses hardware level virtualization.

**Difference between Docker Container vs VMs**

**Docker Container:** 
- Low impact on OS, very fast, low disk space usage.
- Sharing, distribution and re-building is easy.
- Encapsulate apps instead of whole machine.

**VMs:** 
- High impact on OS, Slower, high disk usage.
- Sharing, rebuilding and distribution is challenging.
- Encapsulate whole machine. 

    **------ Advantage of Docker ------**
- No pre-allocation of RAM
- less Cost
- It is light in weight
- Continuous Integrity Efficiency: Docker enables you to build a container image and use that same images across every step of the deployment process.
- It can run on physical Hardware, Virtual Hardware or on Cloud.
- You can reuse image.
- It took very less time to create container.

    **------ Disadvantage of Docker ------**
- Docker is not a good solution for application that requires rich GUI.
- Difficult to manage large amount of container.
- Docker does not provide cross-platform compatibility means if an application is designed to run in a docker container on windows, then it can't run on linux or vice-versa.
- Docker is suitable when the development OS and Testing OS are same if the OS is different, we should use VMs.
- No Solution for Data recovery & Backup.
