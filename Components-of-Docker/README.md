**Docker Daemon: ** 
- Docker daemon runs on the HOST OS.
- It is responsible for running containers to manage docker service.
- Docker Daemon can communicate with other daemons.

**Docker Client: **
- Docker user can interact with docker through a client.
- Docker client uses commands and Rest API to communicate with the docker daemon.
- When a client runs any server command on the docker terminal, the client terminal sends these docker commands to the docker daemons.
- It is possible for docker client to communicate with more than one daemon.
